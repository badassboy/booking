			<h2>Story Behind</h2>
			<p class="explain">The modern-day church is a church which is currently burdened with so much challenges. Issues of managing, retaining and growing itsâ€™ numbers (various denominations) to the issues of keeping proper financial records, managing assets and managing the events calendar, loss of huge volumes of information due to systems crashing, fire outbreaks, theft etc.


The church is often faced with the challenge of how to overcome these challenges and more. Having carefully studied these challenges and the way they affect (the church) in diverse ways. One of such challenges is the cost involved in the putting in place the requisite infrastructure to have a church with several branches in different geographical locations (either a LAN or WAN). CAMS was developed as a one stop solution to help manage the activities of church operations irrespective of location. The major requirement to get CAMS operational for a church is internet connectivity.</p>
